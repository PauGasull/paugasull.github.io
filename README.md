# Pau Gasull's Webpage
The main focus of this project was to have a _Hub_ where to have all the information about my projects and works.
At this moment I don't really have many projects, so the buttons doesn't work. But they will in a future.

## Target user profile
The target of my webpage is, basically, two: 

- Companies that asks for my curriculum or portfolio.
- People who wants to know who im I and my work.

I expect to give them fast and visual information on who I am (my interest, my past, my projects, my hobbies) and what I will do in a futue, in this case the YouTube channel and Art Portfolio on my Ko-Fi. 

## Information Architecture

I wanted to include as much information as possible, such as:

- My face (how do I look like).
- What I am studying.
- How I describe myself.
- What I like.
- What I do in my free time.
- What I'll do in a future.
- What I know and what I'm good at.
- My social medias.

That all the information I included in the main page `index.html`. 
Then, in the `about-me.html` I recreated the Curriculum Vitae I did on paper to give to the business and companies. Including _Home Adress_ so they know the proximity, _Birth Date_ to show my age, _Email_ if they want to contact me and _Phone_ for the same reason; I also added where I studied and what I'm currently studying. My _skills_ and the _languages_ I speak appears too; and, finally, where I worked in the past and where I'm working in the present. 

## Visual design
I tried to replicate a mix between YouTube (the figma project I did in the Figma Exercice) and the Ubuntu terminal style as I have been using Ubuntu lately. To do so I used a dark background color, but I didn't want to use a plain black, so I created and image that is a gradient form dark gray to black (this way I give a bit more color to the web) I also added some blue shadowing to the main titles; I also used the Consolas font to give that kind of computer terminal feeling.

As I don't have that much color in the background, I have not imposed myself a specific color palette. The web's icon is using my profile picture colors, meanwhile I used light and brights colors to give emphasis on links and important things in the web, thanks to this I can redirect the users' view to where I want without being too exaggerated. At nearly the end, I added three buttons that are plain white if the mouse is not hovering and aren't clicked, by doing this I'm asking the user to click them without noticing it; the buttons highlights in the colors I used in the explanation next to the profile image so I don't break the coherence. 

I also wanted to do a visually simple web, I accomplished this not only because of the colors but because I managed to put all the important information, explained on the **Information Architecture**, on the screen without needing to scroll.
